Of course. A good `README.md` file is essential for any project. It serves as the front page, explaining what the project is, what technologies it uses, and how to use it. For you, it's also a perfect "cheat sheet" to summarize your work for the interview.

Here is a complete `README.md` file for the project you just built. You can copy and paste this into a file named `README.md` in your project directory.

# Automated Health Check System for S3-Compatible Object Storage

## Project Overview

This project simulates a proactive monitoring and reporting solution for an enterprise-grade, S3-compatible object storage system. It mirrors the responsibilities of a Technical Support Engineer by demonstrating skills in Linux administration, automation via shell scripting, and interaction with an S3 API.

The core of the project is a `bash` script, `check.sh`, which performs a series of health checks on a MinIO object storage server. This script is scheduled to run automatically every five minutes using `cron`, logging its findings to a daily report file. This entire system was built on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server.

This project is a tangible demonstration of the skills required to support complex storage systems like Cloudian HyperStore.

## Core Technologies Used

* **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
* **Storage System:** MinIO (as a lightweight, S3-API compatible analog for Cloudian HyperStore)
* **Scripting Language:** Bash Shell Scripting
* **API:** S3 (Simple Storage Service) API
* **Scheduling:** `cron`
* **Command-Line Tools:** `mc` (MinIO Client), `df`, `pgrep`, `echo`, `cat`

## Features

* **Service Status Verification:** Automatically checks if the core object storage server process is running.
* **Filesystem Monitoring:** Reports the current disk space usage to prevent storage-full errors.
* **S3 Bucket Auditing:** Connects to the S3 API endpoint to list all available buckets.
* **Object Counting:** Performs a count of objects within a specified critical bucket (e.g., `backups`).
* **Automated Reporting & Logging:** Generates a clean, timestamped report file daily, appending new results from each run. It captures both standard output and errors for effective troubleshooting.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. System Prerequisites
* A running Linux server (tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).

### 2. Installation & Configuration
1.  **Deploy MinIO Server:** The MinIO server is installed and run, exposing an S3-compatible API endpoint on port `9000`.
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/minio-data
    minio server ~/minio-data --console-address :9090
    ```
2.  **Configure MinIO Client:** The `mc` client is configured with an alias (`myminio`) to connect to the local server's API endpoint.
    ```bash
    mc alias set myminio [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000) <ACCESS_KEY> <SECRET_KEY>
    ```

### 3. The Health Check Script (`check.sh`)

The script is placed in `/home/ubuntu/check.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the log file location in the user's home directory
LOG_FILE="/home/ubuntu/health_check_report_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log"

# Use a lock file to prevent the script from running more than once at a time
LOCK_FILE="/tmp/health_check.lock"
if [ -e "$LOCK_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Lock file exists. Another instance may be running."
    exit 1
fi
trap 'rm -f "$LOCK_FILE"' EXIT
touch "$LOCK_FILE"

# --- Start of Report Entry ---
echo "--- Health Check Run at: $(date) ---" >> $LOG_FILE

# --- Check 1: Service Process Status ---
if pgrep -f "minio server" > /dev/null
then
    echo "[OK] MinIO Server Process is RUNNING." >> $LOG_FILE
else
    echo "[FAIL] MinIO Server Process is DOWN." >> $LOG_FILE
fi

# --- Check 2: Disk Space ---
# Gets the usage for the filesystem where the home directory resides
DISK_USAGE=$(df -h /home/ubuntu | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}')
echo "[INFO] Current disk usage is $DISK_USAGE." >> $LOG_FILE

# --- Check 3: S3 API Connectivity & Bucket Listing ---
# The 2>&1 redirects errors so we can log them
MC_LS_OUTPUT=$(/usr/local/bin/mc ls myminio 2>&1)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "[OK] S3 API connectivity is successful." >> $LOG_FILE
    echo "Available Buckets:" >> $LOG_FILE
    echo "$MC_LS_OUTPUT" >> $LOG_FILE
else
    echo "[FAIL] S3 API connectivity failed. Error: $MC_LS_OUTPUT" >> $LOG_FILE
fi

echo "--- End of Run ---" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "" >> $LOG_FILE
````

### 4\. Scheduling with Cron

The script is made executable (`chmod +x check.sh`) and scheduled via `crontab -e` to run every 5 minutes.

```bash
*/5 * * * * /home/ubuntu/check.sh
```

*(Note: Logging is now handled inside the script itself for better control).*

## Relevance to the Cloudian Support Role (Interview Talking Points)

This project directly demonstrates my qualifications for the Technical Support Engineer role:

  * **Linux Proficiency:** Deployed and managed services, edited files, checked processes (`pgrep`), and monitored disk space (`df`) entirely within a Linux environment.
  * **Shell Scripting:** Authored a robust automation script from scratch to perform a series of logical checks and generate a useful report.
  * **Technical Troubleshooting:** The script itself is a troubleshooting tool. It's designed to quickly identify the root cause of potential issues (Is the service down? Is the disk full? Is the API unreachable?).
  * **S3 API Experience:** Used the `mc` client to interact with an S3-compatible endpoint, demonstrating an understanding of how customers use the API (listing buckets, counting objects, etc.).
  * **Proactive Mindset & Reporting:** Instead of waiting for a failure, this project shows initiative in building a proactive monitoring solution. This directly aligns with the responsibility of "Presenting health checks to the customer" and "Reporting proficiency."
  * **Ownership & Automation:** Took ownership of a potential problem (monitoring system health) and created an automated, "hands-off" solution, which is key to supporting large-scale systems efficiently.
